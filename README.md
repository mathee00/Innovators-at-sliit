# Service Circle 

## Introduction to the project
                                          
Finding a trustworthy and skillful individual to paint your house or to clean your building is a difficult task. In the past, we had to search in newspaper ads and in phone directories such as rainbow pages to find suitable professionals. We had to rely on friends, family, or next-door neighbors’ recommendations on the individuals’ quality of work. With the new normal finding, a such professional with such qualities has become even more difficult. Our mobile application “Service Circle” will give a reliable answer to this problem. Service Circle is an application that provides the user with a graphical interface to search for professionals who work in different fields and hire them. For example, Plumbing, Masonry, Cleaning, Housekeeping etc. Since our application provides a platform to hire all kinds of skilled professionals in one place customers can save their time on finding people. Our registered professionals will also be able to find assignments regularly. Now hiring a skilled professional is one touch away.

In our application users should first select a category (Ex – Masonry, Cleaning etc.). Then they will be able to select a professional from the worker list. Once the worker is selected user can send him a request by giving a brief description of the job to be done. According to our system, this will be a job. Then the worker will be able to accept or reject the request according to his/her availability. Also, users can create their job in the system and request services from a worker. In our application workers can create services as well. These services are Ads, which workers will be able to use to advertise their services and expertise. This is beneficial for workers since they can use our platform to promote their services and to connect with users and other workers island wide. We will not be handling the prices for the work or any other transactions because it will be much more convenient for the user to negotiate prices with the worker. After the job is completed, the user will be able to submit a feedback form about the worker and rate his/her work.

We have identified four main functionalities in the system. They are,
1.	User Management
2.	Skilled Worker Management
3.	Job and Service Management
4.	Notification and Feedback Management
